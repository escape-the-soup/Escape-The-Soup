# Escape-The-Soup
You are a shrimp in an aquarium, and you have made it your life’s purpose to escape the filth that is the primordial soup onto the blessed ground. Human hands have always pushed you back in the drink, and it’s time to fight back. You will achieve what no other shrimp has ever achieved before — salvation.
