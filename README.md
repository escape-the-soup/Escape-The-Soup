# Escape The Soup
Escape the Soup is a humorous and relaxing platform adventure-style game. Though not an educational game, Escape the Soup is intended to be informative to those not familiar with the aquarium hobbyist lingo. You are a shrimp in an aquarium, and you have made it your life’s purpose to escape the filth that is the primordial soup onto the blessed ground. Human hands have always pushed you back in the drink, and it’s time to fight back. You will achieve what no other shrimp has ever achieved before — salvation.
